A framework for COMP3702 Assignment 2, by Dimitri Klimenko (tutor).

(0) Completing the assignment!
This archive contains the code that implements the game, as well as a
visualiser to make it easier to view the progress of a game.

Your task is to write the "tracker" package (in the tracker folder),
which will govern how the tracker behaves within the game. In particular,
you must complete the Tracker class, which has two crucial methods you
should implement. You may add methods to the class, but the type signatures
of the methods already present in that class should remain exactly the same.

In particular, the method Tracker.getAction() method will be called by the
game in order to ask the tracker for an action every time it's the tracker's
turn. This method will also be used to pass your tracker the relevant
information that it has obtained since its previous turn.

On the other hand, the Tracker.initialise() method will handle any setup
your tracker requires before it can start outputting actions. Please read the
documentation of these two methods for a more detailed description of how
they should work.

Feel free to make as many classes as you wish; just make sure they're all
in the "tracker" package (or subpackages of tracker, if you wish). You may use
any of the classes in the other packages, but you are not allowed to modify
them - the assignment submission will consist only of the tracker folder and
all of its subfolders.


(1) Commands and arguments
The runnable files and their arguments are:
    game.GameRunner [setup-file] [target-distribution-file] [tracker-distribution-file] [-o output-file]
    visualiser.Visualiser [setup-file] [target-distribution-file] [tracker-distribution-file]

If you compile all the code into "bin" in the project folder (as Eclipse does by
default), the following command-line commands should work:
    java -cp bin game.GameRunner [setup-file] [target-distribution-file] [tracker-distribution-file] [-o output-file]
    java -cp bin visualiser.Visualiser [setup-file] [target-distribution-file] [tracker-distribution-file]

NOTE: If any of these arguments aren't given, the default values are as follows:
setup-file = setup.txt
target-distribution-file = prob-target.txt
tracker-distribution-file =  prob-tracker.txt
output-file = output.txt

The commands above may require full paths to Java; see section (4).


(2) Running the Visualiser
Run the visualiser from Eclipse or from the command line; the JAR has been removed
since it won't work properly if you change the Tracker code unless you
manually recompile the JAR.


(3) Manual Compilation
If you want to compile and run the code manually, you will need to do the
following:
1) Download and install Apache Ant.
2) Extract a2-tools.zip to the desired folder.
3) From within that folder, run the command
    ant


(4) The command line and the system path
Note that for the command-line commands to work Java would have to be on your
system path; if not, you'll have to specify a full path instead of just 
"java", e.g.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_25\bin\java.exe"
or
/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_25/bin/java
