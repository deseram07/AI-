	 * 
	 * It also passes your tracker all of the information it is allowed
	 * to have about the changing of the state of the game. In particular,
	 * this includes the following:
	 * 
	 * @param turnNo the current turn. This is the turn number within the game;
	 * this will be 0 for your very first turn, then 2, then 4, etc. 
	 * This is always even because odd-numbered turns are taken by the targets.
	 * 
	 * @param previousResult the result of the previous attempted action. This
	 * contains four components:
	 * previousResult.getDesiredAction() - the action that was previously
	 * 		attempted by this tracker, or null if there is no such action.
	 *		In other words, this is the output from the last time this
	 * 		method was called, or null if this is the first time this method
	 * 		is being called.
	 * previousResult.getDivergedAction() - the action that resulted after random
	 * 		divergence was applied to your desired action, or null if there was 
	 * 		no such action.
	 * previousResult.getResultingState() - the state this resulted in, which is
	 * 		also the current state of your tracker.
	 * previousResult.getReward() - the reward obtained for the previous
	 * action.
	 * 
	 * @param scores the scores accrued by each individual player.
	 * Note that player #0 is the tracker, and players #1, #2, etc. are
	 * targets. 
	 * In order to win the game, your score will need to be higher than
	 * the total of all of the target scores.
	 * Normally numTargets = 1, so scores will only consist of two numbers.
	 * 
	 * @param newPercepts any percepts obtained by your tracker since
	 * its last turn.
	 * For example, if it's currently turn #2, this will contain any percepts
	 * from turns #0 and #1.
	 * The percept consists of three components:
	 * percept.getAgentNo() - the agent that was seen.
	 * percept.getTurnNo() - the turn after which it was seen.
	 * percept.getAgentState() - the state the agent was seen in.
